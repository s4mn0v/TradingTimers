# How to Make Your Python Binary a Visible App in Ubuntu

## Step 1: Create an Applications Folder

Open a terminal and create a folder for your apps:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Applications
```

Move your binary file into this folder:

```bash
mv /path/to/your/binary ~/Applications/
```

---

## Step 2: Create the App Launcher File

Create a `.desktop` file in the right location:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
nano ~/.local/share/applications/myapp.desktop
```

Copy and paste this template into the editor:

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=My App
Exec=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Applications/your-binary-name
Icon=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Applications/icon.png
Terminal=false
Categories=Utility;
```

**Important changes you must make:**
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username
- Replace `your-binary-name` with your actual file name
- Replace `My App` with whatever name you want to see in the menu
- If you don't have an icon, delete the `Icon=` line

Save and exit:
- Press `Ctrl + O` (save)
- Press `Enter` (confirm)
- Press `Ctrl + X` (exit)

---

## Step 3: Make It Work

Make the launcher file executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/myapp.desktop
```

Refresh the application menu:
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

---

## Done

Press the **Super key** (Windows key) and search for your app by the name you chose. It should appear just like any installed application.

### Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| App doesn't appear in menu | Run `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/` again |
| App appears but won't launch | Check that the `Exec` path in your `.desktop` file is the **full absolute path** to your binary |
| No icon | Either add a `.png` icon file to your Applications folder and set the `Icon` path, or delete the `Icon=` line entirely |
